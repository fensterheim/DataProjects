A briefe explanation of what is contained within each folder:

D3_example:

Housing:
  A solution to the Kaggle Housing prices challenge.
  Main contributions in this project:
    I developed an algorithm to impude missing data by taking NANs as a prediction problem within itself.
    This algorithm will fill in all the missing data by using the most data possible to predict each NAN.

Titanic:
  This was my first datascience project, first I implemented a tutorial, then I attempted on  improving on the tutorial.
  Main contributions in this project:
    I brought domain knowledge of the Titanic blueprints to treat room numbers as 3D coordinates on the ship - the numbers
    were well ordered and had a prefix of the deck, this allowed me to get further features such as which the side of the ship
    in which the caben was located.
