## Titanic:<br>
  ### This was my first datascience project.<br>
  #### Main contributions:<br>
  > - I used domain knowledge of the Titanic blueprints to treat room numbers as 3D coordinates on the ship - the numbers
    were well ordered and had a prefix of the deck, this allowed me to get further features such as which the side of the ship
    in which the caben was located.
